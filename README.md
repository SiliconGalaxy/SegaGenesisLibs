# SegaGenesisLibs
Useful tricks and routines for your sega genesis games.

Hi, my stage name is George Prescott. This github page pretends
to be a place where many useful libraries and programming tricks for
sega genesis will be stored. I know it's probably a mess, but i'll try
to make things the most simple way so everybody can easily understand. 

Please if you find my messy documentation useful and you use it on your project,
consider adding greetings to George Prescott in your credits.
