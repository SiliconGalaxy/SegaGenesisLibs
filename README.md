# SegaGenesisLibs
Usefull tricks and routines for your sega genesis games.

Hi, my artistic name is George Prescott. This github page pretends
to be a place were many usefull libraries and programming tricks for
sega genesis will be stored. I know it's probably a mess, but i'll try
to make things the most simple way so everybody can easily understand. 

Please if you find usefull my messy documentation and you use it on your project,
consider adding greetings to George Prescott at your credits.
